- Utilize Pico W for low-level data collection from
Open Weather Map API via micropython application.
- Use a simple HTTP server in owmapp.main via Python 3
to collect JSON payload from Pico W. The pico will
act as an HTTP client to accomplish payload delivery
a specific endpoint.

## Step 1 (Server-Side)
owmapp needs to listen for incoming payload. Plan to use Flask
- install Flask via pip
- create api.py ro setup a simple web server.
-- this server will have a route that reveives the JSON data
--- import os 
--- import sys
--- from dotenv import load_dotenv
------after pip install flask------
--- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
--- from owmapp.database import MySQLConnection
-- load environment variables via dotenv
-- specify the endpoint for the Pico to send data to
---@app.route('/weather_data', methods=['POST'])

in the database.py file, there needs to be a method created to
recieve the json payload.

## Step 2 (Client-Side)
using MicroPython for the Pico, fetch JSON payload and send it to
owmapp. 
- Pico must be on same network as owmapp http server.
- Pico needs to make a POST request to owmapp via urequests library
-- disable any firewall rules that may be blocking prot 5000 on
server side.
